      <h3>Why web development?</h3>
      <p>The reason I chose to take this course is because I want to learn knew
        concepts of web development that I do not already know about. I am hoping
        to learn as much as possible because I am planning to one day become a
        Fullstack Developer in the future. I hope to learn as much as possible to
        help get me to where I want to be, and I know that this course will help me
        achieve that goal.</p>

      <h3>My experiences</h3>
      <!--I have no idea why the font on this
      paragraph is more bold than the one above it!-->
      <p class="error">I have a very basic understanding of the fundimentals of Web Development(Front-End).
        For example, HTML is perhaps the most basic language that I am very familiar
        with compared to CSS and Javascript. I am familiar with CSS as well, and it
        actually motivates me to create web pages in the first place. The ability
        of being able to customize a website however you want to have it is what
        makes me highly interested in web development. Although I lack knowledge with
        Javascript and the DOM, I think this course will definetly help me expand what
        I know already.</p>
